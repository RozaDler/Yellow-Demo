# Yellow
Yellow is a mood tracking mobile application built using Flutter and Firebase that allows users to monitor their mood fluctuations within certain periods of time. The application uses self-report techniques that allows users to report on their mood fluctuations and share their data with their mental health provider if they wish to do so. Users get to keep a diary of their mood fluctuations and be able to have a visual representation of their moods through colors, charts, and calendar view.
